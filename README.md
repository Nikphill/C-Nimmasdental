# Nimma's Multispeciality Dental Clinic

A single-page marketing website for Nimma's Multispeciality Dental Clinic
(Kamareddy, Telangana) — built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind
CSS v4. The whole site is a self-contained, client-side app: interactive
before/after slider, services guide, appointment-booking flow, clinic
location map, team bios, FAQ, and reviews. There is no backend and nothing
to configure — it just runs.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or later (includes npm)

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

This outputs a fully static site to `dist/` — plain HTML, CSS, and JS, no
server required. Preview the production build locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deploy

Because the build output is fully static, `dist/` can be deployed to any
static host: Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, S3 + CloudFront,
or a plain Nginx/Apache server. Most of these platforms (Netlify, Vercel,
Cloudflare Pages) can also build directly from this repository — just point
them at it; they'll detect Vite automatically and run `npm run build` for you.

## Tech stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite 6** — dev server & build
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — styling, theme defined in `src/index.css`
- **Motion** (`motion/react`) — scroll/animation effects
- **lucide-react** — icons

## Backend (Cloudflare Pages Functions + D1)

Appointments/leads and the staff-portal password are stored in a Cloudflare D1 database via the
`functions/` folder. See **CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md** for the one-time setup (database, `DB` binding,
`STAFF_INITIAL_PASSWORD` secret). To run the site with the backend locally: `npm run cf:dev`.
